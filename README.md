# AKS Playlists

The Azure AKS SRE engagement team has a playlist rotation to help us stay connected. We have a couple full-time distributed team members and COVID-19 has made all of us distributed until close to the end of 2020. Below is a list of the music playlists (mostly Spotify) that we've put together so far.
